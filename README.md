✈️ Airline Demand Analysis Web App

This project is a simulation of a real-world airline booking market demand analysis tool. Originally framed as a technical assessment, the goal was to design a full-stack web application that mimics working with live airline data to provide actionable business insights through a clean, interactive dashboard.

🎯 Objective
Build a web app that analyzes flight demand across major Australian cities, helping hostel businesses optimize operations based on travel patterns. While the frontend interacts with backend APIs, the backend fetches data from a structured CSV dataset to simulate real API responses—ideal for testing, demo, or prototyping purposes.

🚀 Features
Backend API (CSV-powered)
Mimics real-world API calls using a one-week dataset of domestic Australian flights.
Routes implemented with Flask to support data fetching and analytics.
Frontend Dashboard
Built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js.
Users can filter by origin, destination, and date.
Displays:
✈️ Most popular flight routes
📈 Daily price trends
🔥 High-demand months
🛫 In-air flights (simulated)
Data Insights
Data is cleaned and processed on the backend to extract:
Frequently traveled routes
Average price per day
Demand peaks by month
Active (in-air) flights
🧪 Stack
Backend: Python (Flask, pandas)
Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js
Data Source: One-week mock CSV flight dataset (realistic structure)
📊 Use Case
Perfect for testing frontend API integration, prototyping dashboard analytics, or showcasing full-stack skills without needing paid API access or web scraping.
